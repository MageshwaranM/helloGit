As part of the tutorial, I am creating this first readme text file, In this
file I will add the tutorial progress for Git.
The next step after creating this file is to add some text to it and commit to
the folder that I have already created.
And finally I need to use git diff after adding some more lines to the file
and see what happens for that command.
